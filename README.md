# Color-object-generator
 Objects fall and change their color

The project contains a script that, when you press the space button, generates cubes and sphere that fall from the sky.
Each cube and sphere contains a script that changes its color (for a configurable time, not instantly). The script also has a delay before the next color change:
- Changed color
- waited
- Changed color
- waited
And so onâ€¦
